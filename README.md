# Single Page Application Without Using JavaScript Framework

I have created this project to show you how to create a single page application without using any javascript framework (Just simple javascript) :)
I have used an example of a furniture store here.
For Routing purpose i used hashchange eventlistener and manupulating the dom on hash change.

## Installation

Node.js must be installed as we are going to use npm package manager.
Every packages we are going to use is defined in package.json . Just write the below command to run this Project. 

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run build
```
this will build the project and we will use the dist folder to load minified project.

```bash
npm run start
```
this will run your server at 3000 port, feel free to change the port as you want. Look inside the server.js file

## Note

Please first clone the api project from [HERE](https://github.com/Shashank1503/Furniture_API).

I have used webpack to output the files to the dist folder and also to use different loader.

# Work In Progress
